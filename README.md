> _The repo your therapist warned you about._

## 🥶 What Is This?
No one knows. Not even us.  
We wrote this README before writing any actual code.  
Somewhere out there, a developer is crying. Probably us.  

---

## 🧊 Fun (?) Facts
- 80% of bugs are actually **features**.
- The other 20% are our personality.
- Our uptime is 99%… if you ignore the other 73%.
- Tested on production. Failed spectacularly. ✅

---

## 🐌 Features
- Works slowly… like a snail but without the charm.  
- Includes free existential dread.  
- Powered by hope, duct tape, and three AA batteries (not included).  
- Optimized for maximum disappointment.

## 💭 Philosophy
> “Ship it.  
> If it explodes, call it a fireworks show.”

## ❄️ Cold Jokes
- Why do programmers hate nature?  
  → Too many *bugs*.

- Why did the function break up with the variable?  
  → It had **no return**.

- My code runs without errors…  
  → because I commented it all out.  

- This repo is like Schrödinger’s cat.  
  → It’s both finished and broken.

## 📸 Screenshot (Trust Us)
Imagine the Mona Lisa.  
Now imagine someone spilled coffee on it.  
That’s the user interface.
